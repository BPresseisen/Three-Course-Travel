When you are planning a trip to a new place, two of the most intimidating things to know on arrival are:

 -->Where to eat and
 -->What the weather looks like
 
At Three Course Travel we want to ease that stress by giving you a forecast and a taste of what to expect.

Simply input a city name in "Where are you located?" text box on the landing page.

Next, input a different city name in the "Where are you going?" text box.

Then, click the Go! button and watch as the screen is re-drawn with weather information and where-to dining options in both cities.

We're even at work right now on enhancements and new features such as showing destination cuisines in the current city and vice versa, so check back with us regularly!

We aim to satisfy taste buds and travel bugs with the intelligence and the opportunity to experience in your own backyard what will soon be front and center elswhere in your travels.

Three Course Travel is serving up the world!
